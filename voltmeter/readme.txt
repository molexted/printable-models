This is a small box for use with a 1.5 inch panel meter (in this particular application, a ten volt Simpson meter) and a standard pair of bannana jacks.
The holes may be somewhat undersized depending upon the fidelity of the printer; reaming with a drill bit may be neccessary.
The backside is a simple rectangular panel with four holes to permit the use of screws to thread into the body.

Dimensions are 74x54x51 mm (hwd)

Approximately 18 meters of 1.75mm filament are used in this print.
