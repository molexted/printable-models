This is a collection of 3d models which I have created for various (and often custom and non-extensible) devices.
The modes have all been created with OpenSCAD and their sources are included along with the models in STL format.

You are permitted under the terms of this license to share, reproduce, modify, use commercially, and otherwise interface with the work however you wish.
